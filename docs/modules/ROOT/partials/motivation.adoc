:description: Why does asclepias exist?

The extraction and transformation of source data
(such as insurance claims, electronic medical records, or case report forms)
into analysis-ready cohort data consumes an inordinate amount of resources
in a epidemiologic and

research.
In particular, the translation of scientists' analysis plans into code
can be prone to misinterpretation.
Coding a cohort often requires frequent clarification by the scientists,
and a best practice is to have the cohort coded by
by two or more programming teams to ensure quality.

The aim of asclepias is to make
the process of defining, building, and analyzing cohorts
smoother and more robust.
