# Project Asclepias

_Asclepias (n)_:

1. The genus of North American milkweeds, named after Linnaeus after the greek god of healing, Asclepius.
2. A language and software project for defining and deriving features from temporally ordered events using the [interval algebra](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/interval-algebra).

## Current status

The initial versions of `hasklepias` will focus on the ability to derive features from a sorted collection of events. At this time, developers can experiment with feature definitions (see the `examples` directory).

## Getting started

See the [manual](https://docs.novisci.com/asclepias/latest/index.html) and the [examples](examples)
