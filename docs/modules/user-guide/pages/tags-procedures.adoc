:description: The procedure for creating tagSet objects

*Best Practices*
The `TagSet` type `t` should be a sum type object.
Meaning, each possible tag should be enumerated in the type
(`+data MyProjectTags = Diabetes | BirthDay | InHospital | ...+`).
By defining the tag set as a sum type, type safety is ensured.
One cannot misspell a tag or use an undefined tag, for example.

The schema (`m`) type for an `Event` must an instance of
`Eq`, `Show`, `Generic`, and `FromJSON` typeclasses.
The 
https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/generics.html?highlight=derivegeneric#extension-DeriveGeneric[`DeriveGeneric`]
language extension makes deriving the `Generic` instance trivial,
as in the code above.
At this time, users do need to provide the `FromJSON` instance,
and the boilerplate in the example above should work in most cases.

The tag (`t`) type for an `Event` must an instance of
`Eq`, `Show`, `Typeable`, and `FromJSON` typeclasses.
Making `t` `Generic` will also make it `Typeable`,
so in most cases simply `deriving (Eq, Show, Generic)` 
and a stock `FromJSON` instance
is sufficient for the tag type.

The `event-data-theory` packages provides a few utilities for testing
a new model.
These can be found in the `EventDataTheory.Test` module,
which is not included in the main set of exported modules.

The `eventDecodeTests` and `eventDecodeFailTests` functions, for example, test for
successful parsing and successful failed parsing (respectively) 
of `+EventLine m t a+`
into the corresponding `+Event t m a+`.
These functions take a directory path as an argument. 
Each file ending `.jsonl` in that directory should contain
a single `EventLine` as JSON 
to be tested.
See the `test` directory and `EventDataTheory.TheoryTest` module
in this package for examples.
