# Project Asclepias

_Asclepias (n)_:

1. The genus of North American milkweeds, named after Linnaeus after the greek god of healing, Asclepius.
2. A language and software project for defining and generating epidemiological cohorts.

## Getting started

The official implementation of Asclepias is the embedded domain specific language (eDSL) provided by the Hasklepias [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) library. To get started then, you'll need to install the Haskell toolchain, especially the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) (GHC) and the building and packaging system [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/), for which you can use the [`ghcup` utility](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).

You can use any development environment you chose, but for maximum coding pleasure, it is highly recommended that you install the [Haskell language server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server) (`hsl`). This can be installed using `ghcup` or some integrated development environments, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), have [excellent `hsl` integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell).
