A `Context` contains up to three types of information: 

. A `TagSet` (required)
. `Fact` s about the event (required)
. Metadata on the source of the event (optional)

An example of a context is below.

[source,haskell]
----
include::ROOT:example$EventDataTheory/Core.hs[tag=contextType]
----
<1> a `+TagSet+`;
<2> `Fact` s about the event whose shape and possible values
are determined by the `Model` type `m`;
<3> (optionally) data about the provenance of the event in a `+Source+` object.
