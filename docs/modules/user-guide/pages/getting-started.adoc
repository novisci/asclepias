To get started using `asclepias`, there are a few prerequisite tasks.
This section covers instructions on the installation of necessary software tools
and prepping data for use by `asclepias` functions.

## Setting Up Software Tools
To use `asclepias`, you will need to install the Haskell tool chain.
To install, 
follow the directions in the xref:nsBuild:ROOT:haskell-setup.adoc[setup guide],
with these special instructions:

* Use ghc version {ghc}.
* Use cabal version {cabal}.

If you are new to Haskell, 
review the xref:nsBuild:usage-guides:index.adoc[Haskell usage guide] for best practices.

## Data Requirements
To access all the functionality of `asclepias`,
the project data to be in a particular format.
The data must be in JSON file, 
and follow
NoviSci's standard 
{edm-path}/index.html#_event_representation[EDM]
schema where http://ndjson.org/[each line]
in the file is a valid `EventLine`.
See the `+EventLine+` type in event-data-model for more details.
Any project that uses the event-data-model package will meet these requirements.

If the project data is not in this format,
`asclepias` may still be used,
but additional steps will need to be taken by the stat dev team.
Please contact them for more details.
