:description: Lists the features and benefits of asclepias

`asclepias` is a domain specific language and a collection of tools
for defining cohorts.
Benefits of `asclepias` include:

Formally defines a cohort::
`asclepias` provides a formal definition of a cohort specification,
which includes defining one or more **index** events,
a set criteria that determine how subjects will be included or excluded,
and the set of features (i.e. variables) the cohort contains.

Provides tools for defining and testing features::
A `+Feature+` in `asclepias` can be thought of
like covariates, outcomes, or other variables.
`asclepias` includes a language for defining features
of nearly arbitrary shape.
The language elegantly handles failures and
prevents certain programming bugs.

xref:theory:page$feature-theory.adoc[Read about the theory of features]. 

Includes a well-tested library of common features::
Cohorts often include many simple features such as 
indicators that a subject has some condition during a baseline period.
`asclepias` includes templates for many common features.

xref:user-guide:page$index.adoc#templates[See all available templates].

Uses type safety to create better programs::
Programmming languages often used in research such as
SAS, R, python are dynamically, as opposed to statically, typed.
These languages are great for many programming tasks,
but statically typed languages can prevent many common programming errors
by identifying them when the program is compiled.
Most of the `asclepias` tools are written in languages like
https://www.haskell.org/[Haskell]
or
https://dhall-lang.org/[Dhall]
to leverage type safety.

Is easily extensible:: 
Users can create multiple features and/or cohorts following a common pattern
and share these across projects.

Introduces the event data theory::
The event data theory is a framework for defining data models
where the concept of time, as in epidemiology, is critical.  
Having data models of sequences of time-ordered events
often make reasoning about cohorts and features easier.

Is data model agnostic::
While the using a event-based data model is encouraged,
the theory of
xref:theory:cohort-theory.adoc[cohorts]
and
xref:theory:feature-theory.adoc[features]
both work under a "bring your data model" assumption
that does not require an event-based model.
