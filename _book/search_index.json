However, converting source data such as insurance claims, electronic medical records, and case report forms into analysis-ready cohorts consumes an inordinate amount of resources in a research pipeline. The process may involve computationally-intensive transformations of source data into a common data model, preparing an analysis plan by researchers, and programmers who translate the analysis plan and wrangle data into analysis-ready files. Source data -- |ETL| --&gt; Data model \\ |Wrangle| --&gt; Analysis files / Research Qs -- |Write| --&gt; SAP The “wrangle” step is often the most challenging and largest bottleneck in terms of human resources. An analysis plan’s natural language descriptions of the cohort creation algorithm must be translated into code. This step is prone to vague language by scientists and misinterpretations by programmers. Project Asclepias targets this step. 1.1 Emerging, current approaches Original approach was floors of SAS programmers and double programming Describe various solutions such as aetion and ConceptQL (upon which Jigsaw is built) and ODHSI’s ATLAS program 1.2 Asceplias is different Solutions such as ConceptQL and presumably others create a high level language for describing algorithms mapping tightly to a programming language, such as SQL. ConceptQL is indeed quite sophisticated and in many ways this project will appear similar. Still, Project Asclepias takes a somewhat different approach. Asclepias declares a cohort mathematically as composed of algebraic data types and functions that operate on these data types (think category theory). Asclepias provides a rigorous framework for reasoning about, composing, and ultimately computing a cohort. More thoughts: With a rigorous mathematical underpinning: software more straightforward to implement and test a mapping to a more “expressive” language can be derived to be used in writing specifications Moreover, with its mathematical foundation, Asclepias will be implemented using a functional programming approach: “you don’t tell the computer what to do as such but rather you tell it what stuff is.” 1.3 Towards flexible architectures Many programming languages (R, python, scala, and so on) include functional programming concepts. This way of thinking about software design also lends itself to serverless architectures like AWS Lambda. In fact, AWS Lambda gets its name from lambda (or anonymous) functions which come out of the lambda calculus system, upon which pure functional languages are based. "],
["design.html", "Chapter 2 Design 2.1 What is does not do 2.2 From here", " Chapter 2 Design @CITE writes: “One of the important advantages of having a mathematical model for programming is that it’s possible to perform formal proofs of correctness of software. This might not seem so important when you’re writing consumer software, but there are areas of programming where the price of failure may be exorbitant, or where human life is at stake.” In epidemiology and medicine, programming errors can cost lives. Project Asclepias aims to formalize one aspect of the research pipeline: implementing the study plan. @CITE writes: “Functional programmers have a peculiar way of approaching problems. They start by asking very Zen-like questions. For instance, when designing an interactive program, they would ask: What is interaction?” In that vein, what is a cohort? Asclepias defines a cohort \\(C\\) as the output of a mathematical function. Let \\(P\\) be a population and \\(S\\) be a study design that specifies a cohort’s inclusion/exclusion criteria and the set of features needed for analysis. The cohort building function maps a population and a specification to a cohort: \\[ \\Upsilon: (P, S) \\mapsto C \\] This formulation obviously leaves out a lot of details. \\(\\Upsilon\\) will be composed of many other functions and the structure of \\(P\\), \\(S\\), and \\(C\\) need to be described. Asclepias takes a functional approach to cohort building. Existing approaches and cohort building languaage are algorithmic by describing the steps. And while all functions are algorithms not all algorithms are functions. Why does this make a difference? With the goals of: providing a structured language of cohort building that can declare designs from simple to complex reducing the time between planning and execution of analyses providing software that can be scaled to handle massive datasets (?) validated software for a regulated industry 2.1 What is does not do Asclepias does not check that the plan itself is sound or that the population is relevant to the study question. 2.2 From here described at a big picture now going to describe from inside out outline core data types A cohort builder is a function mapping a population and a specification to a cohort: \\[ \\Upsilon: (P, S) \\mapsto C \\] An analysis plan is a function \\(\\Lambda\\) that maps a specification \\(S\\) to a cohort builder. \\[ \\Lambda: S \\mapsto ( C: P \\mapsto C ) \\] The next 4 chapters describe the design of \\(P\\) and data types it is composed of \\(C&#39;\\) and the function types it is composed of \\(C\\) and the data types it is composed of Before demostrating a complete working example starting from \\(S\\) and \\(\\Lambda\\), we first explain how \\(C&#39;\\) works with toy example building a cohort “by hand” using the types \\(S\\) and how a specification defines all of the above "],

Here’s a few \\(\\Xi\\)s represented visually: To make the math concrete, define data structures in a programming language (in this case R) that align with our mathematical definition. itv &lt;- interval(a = 2L, b = 4L) itv ## (2, 4) We’re going to get into functions later, but a few basic functions might help contextualize what we can do with the interval data structure.

Starting with simple accessor functions (\\(s\\) and \\(e\\)) and basic set, relational, and arithmetic operators, we created simple functions from which more complicated functions can be composed (as we will see).

A context is always paired with a \\(\\Xi\\) as an event (defined below) and contains all the relevant information about the \\(\\Xi\\) such as a type and associated values. For the purposes of this demonstration, let the context be the pair the suit and value of a poker card: \\[ \\square \\in \\{suit \\in \\mathcal{S} = \\{\\clubsuit, \\heartsuit, \\diamondsuit, \\spadesuit \\}, value \\in \\mathcal{V} = \\{A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 , 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K\\}\\} \\] Let \\(\\overline{\\square}\\) be the set of all contexts specific to our study. Define a couple of accessor functions for our specific context: Definition Mapping Description \\(suit(\\square)\\) \\(suit : \\overline{\\square}\\ \\mapsto \\mathcal{S}\\) Gets the suit of a context. \\(value(\\square)\\) \\(value : \\overline{\\square}\\ \\mapsto \\mathcal{V}\\) Gets the value of a context c1 &lt;- context(suit = suit(&quot;heart&quot;), value = &quot;3&quot;) c2 &lt;- context(suit = suit(&quot;diamond&quot;), value = &quot;J&quot;) suit(c1) ## ♥ suit(c2) ## ♦ value(c1) ## [1] &quot;3&quot; value(c2) ## [1] &quot;J&quot; 3.3 Contextualized Set This pattern repeats through the design: \\[ \\{ \\square, \\cdot \\} \\] where \\(\\cdot\\) is some set. TODO: further describe this type. 3.4 Events The fundamental data structure in this setup is that of events occurring in time with information attached to the event such as a hospital stay, disease diagnosis, or lab values. We most often work on the time scale of days, so for now we’ll think about the time intervals in terms of integers. Define an event \\(w\\) as a set with an interval and a context: \\[ w := \\{\\Xi, \\square\\} \\] event(interval = itv, context = c1) ## {(2, 10), {♥, 3}} event(interval = interval(a = 4L, b = 20L), context = c2) ## {(4, 20), {♦, J}} 3.5 Event History Events are collected into an indexed, partially ordered set: \\[ W = \\{ (w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n) \\mid \\Xi_i \\leq \\Xi_{i + 1} \\: \\forall i = 1, \\dots, n -1 \\} \\] Here’s a randomly generated set \\(W\\): ## {(1, 6), {♦, 10}}, ## {(3, 3), {♥, 5}}, ## {(4, 4), {♥, 3}}, ## {(7, 7), {♠, 10}}, ## {(12, 12), {♦, J}}, ## {(17, 17), {♦, 4}}, ## {(18, 20), {♣, 2}}, ## {(27, 31), {♠, 5}}, ## {(27, 33), {♥, 8}}, ## {(38, 47), {♣, 8}}, ## {(39, 47), {♣, 5}}, ## {(40, 40), {♣, 5}}, ## {(44, 54), {♦, K}}, ## {(46, 51), {♠, J}}, ## {(55, 63), {♠, 10}}, ## {(65, 65), {♥, 10}}, ## {(67, 67), {♠, 3}}, ## {(82, 85), {♠, 6}}, ## {(82, 91), {♣, 10}}, ## {(95, 95), {♦, K}} And here’s \\(W\\) represented graphically where y-axis is used to differentiate each \\(w\\) by its suit: 3.6 Subject A subject, patient or unit is a context and an event history: \\[ U = \\{ \\square, W\\} \\] 3.7 Population A population is a context and a unordered set of subjects: \\[ P = \\{\\square, \\{U_1, \\dots, U_m \\} \\} \\] TODO: define a way of ordering populations?

["function-types.html", "Chapter 4 Function Types 4.1 Accessors 4.2 Predicates 4.3 Filters", " Chapter 4 Function Types 4.1 Accessors As described above, accessor functions extract information from an event \\(w\\).

Defined similarly for a set of events: \\[ \\mathsf{P}^c : (\\mathsf{a}, \\cdot) \\mapsto \\mathsf{P}: W \\mapsto \\{\\{0, 1\\}^n\\} \\] Predicates are constructed from acessors and relations.

Then we can apply that pattern to create the scangap function. scangap_cast &lt;- function(cc){ function(l){ Reduce( f = function(x, y){ c(check_gap_cast(cc, c(1, 2, 1, 1))(x, y), check_gap_cast(0, c(2, 2, 2, 2))(x, y)) }, x = l, accumulate = TRUE) } } scangap_cast(10)(head(Wdt$xy)) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 6 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 1 6 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 1 6 ## ## [[4]] ## [1] 1 7 ## ## [[5]] ## [1] 1 12 ## ## [[6]] ## [1] 1 17 In summary, scangap return a set of tuples the same length as the input \\(W\\), where the start and end of each \\(w_i \\in W\\) have been updated depending on \\(w_{i - 1}\\) extending the period until a time gap of 10 units occurs. Now, we can identify which of those periods are the non overlapping periods by scanning the modified periods from the right, accumulating an indicator of whether each period is the longest segment of a period; then we can use set (list) comprehension to filter to the unique periods. For example, (warning: this is klunky and could be cleaned up), but in R: # Finds the longest non-overlapping periods scan_periods_cast &lt;- function(cc){ function(l){ Map( function(x) as.logical(x[3]), Reduce( f = function(a, b) c(a, (a[2] + cc &lt;= b[1]) * 1), x = l[-length(l)], init = c(l[[length(l)]], 1), accumulate = TRUE, right = TRUE) ) } } period_cast &lt;- function(cc){ ff &lt;- scan_periods_cast(cc) gg &lt;- scangap_cast(cc) function(l){ gg(l)[unlist(ff(gg(l)))] } } period_cast(10)(Wdt$xy) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 67 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 82 95 period_cast(10)(head(Wdt$xy)) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 17 Now we have need a function that limits our periods to just those that overlap another period \\(pd\\) (e.g. a lookback period). This is the \\(pdperiod\\) function. pdperiod &lt;- function(l, p){ Filter( f = function(z) { !(p[2] &lt; z[1]) &amp;&amp; !(p[1] &gt; z[2]) }, x = l ) } period_cast(10)(Wdt$xy) %&gt;% pdperiod(p = c(4, 10)) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 67 period_cast(10)(Wdt$xy) %&gt;% pdperiod(p = c(-10, 10)) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 67 period_cast(10)(Wdt$xy) %&gt;% pdperiod(p = c(-10, 90)) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 67 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 82 95 # Define a couple of helper function s &lt;- function(p) p[1] e &lt;- function(p) p[2] h &lt;- function(p1, p2){ if(s(p2) &lt; s(p1) &amp;&amp; e(p2) &lt;= e(p1)){ list(c(e(p2), e(p1))) } else if(s(p1) &lt;= s(p2) &amp;&amp; e(p1) &lt; e(p2)){ list(c(s(p1), s(p2))) } else if(s(p1) &lt;= s(p2) &amp;&amp; e(p2) &lt;= e(p1)){ list(c(s(p1), s(p2)), c(e(p2), e(p1))) } else { NULL } } f &lt;- function(l, p2){ out &lt;- l[-length(l)] p1 &lt;- l[[length(l)]] hold &lt;- h(p1, p2) append(out, hold) } h(c(1, 10), c(0, 5)) h(c(1, 10), c(2, 5)) h(c(1, 10), c(0, 11)) pds &lt;- list( c(2, 5), c(10, 15), c(16, 17) ) gap_cast &lt;- function(pd){ function(periods){ Reduce(f, periods, init = list(pd)) } } shift_period &lt;- function(p, x){ x + p } lookback &lt;- shift_period(c(-25, 0), index(W)) preindex_gaps &lt;- gap_cast(lookback) # period_cast(10)(Wdt$xy) %&gt;% # clip_period(p = lookback) # # h(lookback, c(1, 67)) # %&gt;% # Reduce(f, ., init = list(lookback)) Now let’s build foreverDiamonds Ldiamond &lt;- Lsuit_cast(&quot;diamond&quot;) foreverDiamonds &lt;- function(W){ Ldiamond(W) %&gt;% A_prd %&gt;% { period_cast(10)(.) } %&gt;% preindex_gaps %&gt;% { length(.) &gt; 0} } foreverDiamonds(W) Note that another pattern emerged!
