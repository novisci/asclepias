:description: The procedure for defining the output data shape

The output data is defined in the `Cohorts.hs` file,
and should match the specifications for your project.

Below is an example of an output type using `Event` format.
The output type for `Event` data should always be `Featureset`.

#TODO - it's hard to see the "shape" of the output data based on this#
#What will a Featureset look like?#
#Also, I didn't think features were needed to create a cohort?#

featureRunner :: Interval Day -> Es Day -> Featureset
featureRunner i es = do
  let ix        = pure i
  let ev        = pure es
  let flwevents = eval defFlwupEvents ix ev

  featureset
    (  packFeature (eval defAge ix ev)
    :| [packFeature (eval defOutcome flwevents)]
    <> statinCovariates ix ev
    )

Below is an example of a custom output type.

type OutputData = (Fanaticism, Maybe Integer)
