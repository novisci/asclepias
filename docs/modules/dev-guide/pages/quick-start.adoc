= Quick start

[NOTE]
If using an M1 mac, 
xref:m1-mac.adoc[see additional instructions].

In this section we provide a quick start guide
for getting up and running with asclepias development.
In future sections we cover all of these steps in greater detail.

. Clone the project: `git clone ++git@gitlab.novisci.com:nsStat/asclepias.git++`
. Install the Haskell toolchain
.. Install ghcup: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf ++https://get-ghcup.haskell.org++ | sh`
.. Install GHC: `ghcup install ghc {ghc}`
.. You may need to install Cabal: `ghcup install cabal`
.. You may need to install HLS: `ghcup install hls`
. Compile all of the project components (this may take half an hour): `cabal build all`
. Set up your editor for Haskell development using HLS.
  This is editor-specific.
