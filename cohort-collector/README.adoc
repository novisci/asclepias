= Cohort Collector

The `cohort-collector` application provides a utility for combining cohorts 
*built from the same cohort specification*. 
A common use case is combining cohort data created on different partitions of event data. 
The application takes a single text file containing one filepath per line as input.
The file can be located either on the local file system or on S3. 

The latest linux executable can be downloaded from:
