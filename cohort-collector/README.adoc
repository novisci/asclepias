= Cohort Collector

The `cohort-collector` application provides a utility for combining cohorts *built from the same cohort specification*. A common use case is combining cohort data created on different partitions of event data.

The application takes a single text file containing a one filepath per line as input. The file can be located either on the local file system or on S3. 

== Usage

[source]

include::help.txt[]

== Example usage

Suppose we have 3 cohort json files we want to combine.

.testcw1.json
[source]
include::{testdir}/testcw1.json[]

.testcw2.json
[source]
include::{testdir}/testcw2.json[]

.testcw3.json
[source]
include::{testdir}/testcw3.json[]

To combine these files, we provide a manifest file:

.manifest.txt
[source]
include::{testdir}/manifestcw.txt[]

Then the `cohort-collector` app can be run from the same directory as the location of the manifest file: 

[source,shell]
----
$ cohort-collector -f manifestcw.txt
{"example":[{"attritionInfo":[{"attritionCount":2,"attritionLevel":{"contents":[1,"dummy"],"tag":"ExcludedBy"}},{"attritionCount":5,"attritionLevel":{"tag":"Included"}}],"totalProcessed":7},{"contents":{"attributes":[{"attrs":{"getDerivation":"","getLongLabel":"another label","getPurpose":{"getRole":["Outcome"],"getTags":[]},"getShortLabel":"somelabel"},"name":"myVar1","type":"Count"},{"attrs":{"getDerivation":"","getLongLabel":"","getPurpose":{"getRole":[],"getTags":[]},"getShortLabel":""},"name":"myVar2","type":"Bool"}],"cohortData":[[5,5,10,99,86],[true,true,false,true,true]],"ids":["a","b","c","d","f"]},"tag":"CW"}]}
