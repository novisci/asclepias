:description: Documentation of the BuildIsEnrolled template
:source-highlighter: highlightjs

= `buildIsEnrolled`: Does an enrollment event concur with index?

[TIP]
====
Use this template to create a `Definition` of a `Feature`
for a `Status` where:

* [x] you have a predicate for identifying enrollment events;
* [x] you want to know whether a subject was enrolled
(in a health plan, e.g.)
at an index time;
* [x] the result will be used as inclusion/exclusion status.
