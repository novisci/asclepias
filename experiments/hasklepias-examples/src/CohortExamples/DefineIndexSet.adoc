= Defining an Index Set 

This example demonstrates:

* [x] how to create an index set

In this example,
index is defined as the first time that a subject was bitten by an Orca
(ICD10 codes W56.21/W56.21XA).

<1> The input type for this example is a list of events, 
where the tag set is `Text`, 
the data model is `ExampleModel`,
and the interval time is a generic type `a`.
<2> The return type is an `Indexset` of `Interval`.
The `IndexSet` type is defined in `hasklepias-core`
as either `Nothing` or a set of *unique* ordered values.
<3> To determine whether a subject has an index,
we filter to the events tagged with the tag `"wasBitByOrca"`.
<4> The `headMay` function gets the first event,
if one exists.
We're assuming the input list has already been sorted.
<5> Then we get the interval, 
if it exists.
<6> The `into` function casts the output from <4> into a `IndexSet (Interval a)` type.
