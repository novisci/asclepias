:description: Why does asclepias exist?

The extraction and transformation of source data
(such as insurance claims, electronic medical records, or case report forms)
into analysis-ready cohort data consumes an inordinate amount of resources
in epidemiologic and

research.
Moreover, the translation of scientists' analysis plans into code
can be prone to ambiguity and misinterpretation.

The aim of `asclepias` is to make epidemiologic research
less effort,
less error-prone,
and more robust by
providing a collection of domain specific languages
that both scientists and programmers can reason with and understand.
