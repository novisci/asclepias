= Versioning `asclepias`

`asclepias` tries to follow
https://semver.org/[semantic versioning 2.0.0].

[NOTE]
While each component package of `asclepias` has its own version,
the primary version of `asclepias` is the version in `+hasklepias-main+`.
That is, when we refer to the "version of `asclepias`",
we mean the version number in `+hasklepias-main+`. 

Starting with version `0.24.0`,
release branches should be named by the version number starting with `v`
and without the patch number.
For example, `v0.24` is the release branch for the `0.24` line
(`0.24.0`, `0.24.1`, etc).

[TIP]
The `antora-playbook.yml` file in the
https://gitlab.novisci.com/nsStat/noviverse-site[`noviverse-site` repository]
determines which branches of `asclepias` are used for the documentation site.


[CAUTION]
Until `asclepias` version `1.0` is released,
no guarantees of backwards-compatability are made.
