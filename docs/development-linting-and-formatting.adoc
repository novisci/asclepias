= Linting and Formatting

The CI process checks that code in the repository is appropriately formatted and linted,
using the
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brittany[`brittany`]
and
https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint[`hlint`]
tools respectively.

You can install these locally using (e.g.) `cabal`:

[source,shell]
----
cabal install brittany
cabal install hlint
----

or `nix` (e.g. for `hlint`):

[source,shell]
----
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.hlint
----

Scripts are provided to format code locally with:

[source,shell]
----
./scripts/format.sh
----

or linted using:

[source,shell]
----
./scripts/lint.sh
----
