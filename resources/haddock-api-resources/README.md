# README

The files in `haddock-api-resources` were copied from the
[haddock repo](https://github.com/haskell/haddock)
at commit `677884577dee1cb51772d9bc21cc69f11f48af34`.

These files are (currently) necessary for to build a single haddock site
for a multi-package cabal project.

See:

* [haddock docs](https://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multi-components.html)
* [example repo](https://github.com/coot/haddock-example)
