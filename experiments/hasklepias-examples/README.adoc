= hasklepias examples

Provides examples to serve as documentation for the asclepias project.

== Organization notes

Any examples in the `CohortExamples` or `FeatureExamples`
directory should be documented and presented on the asclepias site.
This requires writing an `.adoc` file alongside the source code file,
and adding an extry for the example in either:
`docs/modules/cohorts/pages/examples.adoc` or
`docs/modules/features/pages/examples.adoc`.

Some examples are as yet undocumented on the asclepias docs site,
due to lack of time,
need for further development,
questioning its utility, 
and so on.
Such examples are in the `UndocumentedExamples` module,
so that the code is compiled and tests are run.
From time to time, examples in this directory should be vetted and
either documented or removed.
