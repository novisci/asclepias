# Special Instructions for M1 Mac

While installing the Haskell suite, you may run in to an
error message like this:

----
<no location info>: error:
    Warning: Couldn't figure out LLVM version!
             Make sure you have installed LLVM between [9 and 13)
----

If you do, you'll need to install a second version of llvm.
If using homebrew, run `brew install llvm`.

(To install homebrew, `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`)

After installing the second version of llvm, you'll need to 
add the following line to the appropriate shell startup file
(either $\{HOME}/.zshrc or $\{HOME}/.bashrc):

`export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"`
