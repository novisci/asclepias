= Building `asclepias` packages 
This section outlines `asclepias`-specific build instructions.
For details on building Haskell projects in general,
see the {url-usage-guide}[Usage Guide]. 

The `asclepias` repository is organized using a multiple project setup.
Some of the subdirectories of the repository 
such as `hasklepias-core`, `hasklepias-main`, etc. 
contain a Cabal package that we call a "project" or "sub-project".

We can choose which subset of projects to build, 
including theentire `asclepias` project, 
using the `cabal build` command as outlined in the {url-usage-guide}[Usage Guide]. 

[NOTE]
..Best Practice
====
Build the entire `asclepias` project only after all edits are complete. 
This saves compile time.
